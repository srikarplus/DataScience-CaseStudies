Uber, a very popular raid hailing service wants to improve its business by analyzing the data they have collected. 
Particularly Uber is interested in knowing the issues faced by customers such as problem of cancellation by cab drivers , 
non availability of cabs in any hour of the day. These very issues also impact the business of Uber. If drivers cancel 
the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue. In this analysis I tried to address some 
pressing problems faced by Uber and provide some possible solutions.
