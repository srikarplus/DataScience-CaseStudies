# Gramener CaseStudy  
A consumer finance company specializes in lending various types of loans to customers. 
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan 
approval based on the applicant’s profile. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a 
person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the 
amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
